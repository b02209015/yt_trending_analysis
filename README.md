## Research Question
The primary research question is to analyze the factors that affect the popularity of a YouTube video. The secondary research questions could be performing statistical analysis over time and sentiment analysis around a video.


## Plan for Data Analysis
-	Exploratory Data Analysis: To perform statistical analysis on the data in order to better understand the data and generate insights and hypothesis based on the EDAs performed

-	Data Cleaning: To identify null values and outliers and treat them

-	Feature Selection and Engineering: To identify the scope for deriving new features/variables and then identify the most important features that affect the popularity of a YouTube video

-	Modeling: To build a model to identify the sentiment around a video using the comments and test the accuracy of the model by using sampling and validation techniques.
